Crimson offers a superset of the cryptographic features available in the .NET
framework. For various reasons Crimson isn't distributed within Mono. The main 
reasons being:

* Target audience

	As a superset to both .NET and Mono cryptographic features, Crimson
	is useful to everyone, not just Mono users.

* Support

	Crimson is not required inside Mono to reach feature parity with MS 
	implementation of the .NET framework and it's related tools. As such
	supporting Crimson is not the goal of the Mono project.

* Export restriction on cryptographic software

	Laws regarding export and, sometimes import, of cryptography are 
	diverse and complex. It is difficult to add/remove algorithms and 
	keep all the required paperwork in sync. Distribution as source-only
	makes this a lot easier.
