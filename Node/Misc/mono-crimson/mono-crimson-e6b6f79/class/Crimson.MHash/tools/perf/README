Mono has managed implementation of the following hash algorithms:

* mscorlib.dll: MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512 and, only in 2.0, RIPEMD160
* Mono.Security.dll: SHA224, MD2 and MD4

Most UNIX system also have a md5sum and sha1sum that can be used to compare
performance.

HOWTO

	make
	mono bf.exe bigfile 1000000
	time md5sum bigfile
	time mono managed.exe MD5 bigfile
	time mono native.exe MD5 bigfile

Change size (x10) and retry.
