Crimson.MHash.dll


* How to use

In most cases you shouldn't reference this assembly directly. E.g. it is not
required if you want performance benefits of using the native implementation 
of the common hash algorithms. The .NET framework has a plug-able design that 
allow re-mapping the implementations at runtime (using machine.config).

However if you want to access the less common hash algorithms you'll need to
reference Crimson.MHash.dll directly in your projects (or copy the required
source files in your project).


* License

The C# files are all MIT X.11 licensed. However MHash itself is LGPL, so the
end result is LGPL. The C# files are MIT X.11 licensed so they can be easily
reused to wrap other native cryptographic libraries (without making the new
project LGPL).


* Notes

The generated files are kept in SVN to allow anyone to build this assembly 
even if the libmhash library isn't present on their system. However executing
or testing the assembly won't work unless the library is present.
